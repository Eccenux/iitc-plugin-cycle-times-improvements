# IITC plugin: Show cycle/checkpoint times improved

Show the times used for the septicycle and checkpoints (as the original plugin). Additionally shows delta time info.

Assuming you already have IITC just [install the script](https://github.com/Eccenux/iitc-plugin-cycle-times-improvements/raw/master/cycle-times-improvements.user.js).

Remember to uninstall/deactivate original plugin.
